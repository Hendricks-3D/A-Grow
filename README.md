# A-Grow
A-grow is a mobile application for farmers and is paired with a angular desktop application that shares its data through firebase database.

A grow was developed with angular 5 and ionic 4 in 2018 as a tool for farms to report 
their problems to the local agricultural bodies in a country.
A-grow was used to win the United Nation Hack Against Hunger Hackathon
held in switzerland.
